# GRID SPECIFICATION
#
#================================================================

# these properties will generate a separate, custom grid for each station. 
# Because property geotessOutputGrid is not specified, the station-specific grids
# will be stored in the output libcorr3d model files, not in separate files.

# rotate the grid so that grid vertex 0 is located at the location of the station
geotessRotateGridToStation = true

# all grid points past 'geotessActiveNodeRadius' (degrees) from the station will be populated with NaN.
geotessActiveNodeRadius = 30

# Refine the grid in a spherical cap around the station.  
# The parameters of the spherical_cap definitions are:
#     1 - latitude  of center of the cap, in degrees.  (<site.lat> is replaced with latitude of current site)
#     2 - longitude of center of the cap, in degrees.  (<site.lon> is replaced with longitude of current site)
#     3 - radius of the spherical cap in degrees.
#     4 - tessellation index.  Always 0 for pcalc applications.
#     5 - grid resolution inside the cap, in degrees.

#
# DEPTH SPECIFICATION
#
#================================================================

# Prefered depth distribution is 2 km until 10, then 5 km until 50, then 10 until 100, 20 until 200, 50 until 400, then 100.
#geotessDepths = -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700
# but since this is just an example and we want it to run fast, just specify 3 depths:
geotessDepths = -6, 0, 700

# When property geotessDepths is used to specify a list of depths, and a seismicity depth model
# is being used to constrain model depths (true by default), the following procedure is implemented.
# At each grid vertex, the minimum and maximum depths in the seismicity depth model at the geographic 
# location of the grid vertex are identified.  The list of depths specified by property geotessDepths 
# is truncated to ignore depths above the minimum depth and depths below the maximum depth.  Then either 
# additional depths are added at the minimum and maximum depths or the first and last depths in the 
# modified list of depths are adjusted such that the minimum and maximum depths in the depth list correspond 
# to the minimum and maximum depth retrieved from the seismicity depth model. 

#================================================================
#
# SITE SPECIFICATION
#
#================================================================

# There are two ways to specify sites.  They can be specified in a separate file or they can be
# specified in this pcalc properties file.  See appendix in the PCalc User's Manual for discussion.

# Specifying an external siteFile is most convenient when computing models for many sites
# on multiple computers.  PCalc can be launched on multiple machines with the same properties file.
# siteFile = xxx

# Many sites may be specified, separated by a semi-colon, and will be processed one at a time.  
# A '\' character at the end of any line in a properties file is a continuation character
