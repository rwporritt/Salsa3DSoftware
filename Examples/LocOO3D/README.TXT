To run the example in file_io_libcorr3d it is necessary to run supportmap to 
establish the mapping from the libcorr3d models in the 
libcorr3d_models_tt_delta_ak135 directory and the Site objects in the Data 
directory.  To accomplish this cd into the LocOO3D/Examples directory (the 
directory where this README.TXT file resides) and execute 

supportmap supportMap.properties
