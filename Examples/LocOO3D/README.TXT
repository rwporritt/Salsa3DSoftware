To run the examples in subdirectories file_io_simple, file_io_libcorr3, database_io_simple,
file_io_bender and file_io_rstt cd into each of those subdirectories and run
locoo3d example.properties
when the calculations are complete, compare the new output locoo3d_output.txt
with the expected output in locoo3d_output_original.txt

To run the database_io_simple example, the examples.properties file will have to be
edited and database configuration properties set to correct values.
